````

#### Install requirements

````shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

````

## Brief

- Create, Update, Delete and List web service endpoints for a User object.
- User object should contain a name, email address, password and the date of theirlast login.
- Provide a login endpoint that validates the email address and password provided by the user matches the one stored in
  the database

## Application

### Summary

| Component             | Framework/Library          | Why                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Python                | --                         | Most experience with.                                                                                                    |
| API                   | Flask/FlaskRESTful         | Rapid prototyping with large eco-system of feature plugins.                                                              |
| Database              | SQLite                     | Good for proto-typing and fast dev-test cycle with in-memory functionality ideal for repeatable unit/functional testing. |
| ORM                   | SQLAlchemy                 | Easier to work with and faster turn around time than writing raw SQL. Better code readability.                           |
| DTO/Schema            | Marshmallow                | Easy transfer of database objects/Request bodies into various data-structures including Dicts/Dataclasses/Namespaces.    |
| Login/Role Management | FlaskHTTPAuth              | Supplies a simple role based system out-of-the-box, protects endpoints using the intuitive decorator pattern.            |
| Token Access          | FlaskHTTPAuth/itsdangerous | Allows both Bearer Token and Basic Authentication.                                                                       |
| Password Hashing      | Werkzeug                   | Clear interface for hashing passwords before saving to database and for verifying hashed passwords on login attempts.    |

## Testing

Testing was carried out using the PyTest framework.

The image below depicts the granular coverage report for the delivered application.

## CICD Pipeline

A simple CI/CD flow is created to showcase understanding of core DevOps fundamentals and to keep code honest outside the
original development environment.

### Pipeline Architecture

![CICD Architecture](./docs/img/cicd_arch.png)

### Future Work

Due to timing constraints, some aspects of the project were not fully realised, this section is supplied to highlight to
where additional time would have been spent.

- ‚ùó Add additional endpoint, allowing admins to create a User.
- ‚ùó Add Docker support for better test/deployment support.

    - ‚úîÔ∏èSemi-realised by Travis CI, which builds a docker container to run tests on, ensuring no hidden dependencies are
      on local machine

- ‚ùó Deploy to PaaS provider such as Digital Ocean or Heroku or a CSP such as AWS or Azure.
